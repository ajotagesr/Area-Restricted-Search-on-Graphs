> **Area-Restricted Search (ARS)** is an almost universal animal behavior that applies to phenomena as different as the movement of bacteria, the search for food, the observation of images, or the resolution of abstract problems. ARS can be carried out in any conceptual space. It consists of a local search that continues as long as the local environment provides resources (be them food, information, etc.) and, when locally the resources begin to be scarce, ARS effectuates long jumps to explore new areas of the physical or conceptual space.
> 
> In this work we shall try to apply the concepts of ARS to a graph. This will result in a resource driven random walk that will explore the graph looking to accumulate as many resources as possible. We shall study and simulate the walk and compare it with other random walks that look for information (such as the PageRank walk).
